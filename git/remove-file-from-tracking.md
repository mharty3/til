# Stop tracking a file in version control

If you want to stop tracking a file (ie remove it from version control) while keeping it in the repository, run the following command on the file. Sometimes I need this when I accidentally commit files in a directory before I set up the .gitignore files.

`git rm --cached <file-name>`
